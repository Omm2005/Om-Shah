I'm a Mathematics Major at [San Jose State University](https://sjsu.edu/) (also a builder and full stack developer) researching on the Math behind AI and Machine Learning.

I have programmed and built robots for <a href="https://www.moorparkcollege.edu/engineering-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my community college's VEXU team</a>, where I worked extensively on autonomous navigation. This included experimenting with AI-based sensors and image-processing techniques to enable the robot to perceive its environment. I also applied PID control and odometry to develop reliable autonomous movement routines. Outside of competition, I created an Arduino-based version of the Chrome Dino game as a personal project, allowing me to explore embedded systems and game logic for fun.

I have tutored Precalculus and Calculus, founded and sold a company, and collaborated on content creation with <a href="https://x.com/dhravyashah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@dhravyashah</a>. I've also won hackathons like <a href="https://diamondhacks.acmucsd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DiamondHacks</a>.
